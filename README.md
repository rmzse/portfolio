# TO-DO
- fix the menu so that the drop-down works on small screens
- fix so that the img content in the link boxes is centered, alternatively add images as box backgrounds and work with onClick objects inside the box
- upgrade to make use of Foundation's full capacity through an nmp install of one of the starter projects (perhaps the advanced projet starter pack?)
- add icons representing the languages used in the holder-body, depending on what the yml file has in store
- update responsive font to ho fixed intervals in screen sizes
